# Error Bars User Study
Replicated experiment for the paper "Error Bars Considered Harmful: Exploring Alternate Encodings for Mean and Error" by Michael Correll and Michael Gleicher 

The goal of this user study is to evaluate the performance of different type of error bars (bar chart, box plot, gradient plot, and violin plot). This experiment was originally conducted in 2014 when the paper was written. This replicated experiment was redone on December of 2018 to see if the results from the original experiment still holds true.
